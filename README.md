# Etch-A-Sketch üñºÔ∏è

## Summary
a choose-your-own-grid-size, pastel-colored Etch-A-Sketch

## Lessons Learned
* DOM Manipulation - I had fun creating the mouse event listeners, particularly for the square color change functionality!
* CSS Flexbox and Grid - I was very excited to learn how to use flexbox and grid together.

## Future Improvements
* Randomized color and gradient options
* UI for choosing grid size
* Advanced CSS styling
* Responsive layout for different devices/screen sizes
